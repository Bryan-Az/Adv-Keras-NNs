# [Part 2] Tensorboard: Normalization, Optimization, Training, and Evaluation
In this section, a model is created that customizes important model attributes such as normalization, optimization, loss, and activation and Hyperparameter tuning.

 > Normalization applied: alpha dropout via custom layer.

 > Optimizer and Initialization applied: momentum optimization via custom optimizer & learning rate scheduler, with He Normal initialization.

 > Loss Metric Applied: HuberLoss.

 > Activation Applied: Leakly ReLU

> Hyperparameter tuning: KerasTuner and Tensorboard.
