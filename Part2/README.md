# [Part 2] Tensorboard: Normalization, Optimization, Training, and Evaluation
In this section, methods like Tensorboard, normalization layers, optimization techniques, model training, and tuning of the weight initializer, loss activation and evaluation metrics are implemented.

 > Normalizations applied: alpha dropout via custom layer, a custom tensorflow.Dataset in the training loop.

 > Optimizers applied: momentum optimization via custom optimizer & learning rate scheduler, a custom ResNet (Residual Network) model with He Normal initialization.

 > Loss/Eval Metrics Applied: HuberLoss, HuberMetric.

 > Activations Applied: ReLU, Leakly ReLU
