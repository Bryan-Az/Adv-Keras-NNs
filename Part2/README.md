# [Part 2] KerasTuner, Normalization, Optimization, Training, and Evaluation
In this section, the tabular model in part 1 is advanced by adding important model attributes such as normalization, optimization, loss, and activation and Hyperparameter tuning.

 > Normalization applied: alpha dropout via custom layer.

 > Optimizer and Initialization applied: momentum optimization via custom optimizer, with He Normal initialization.

 > Loss Metric Applied: HuberLoss.

 > Activation Applied: A custom l1 regularizer

> Hyperparameter tuning: KerasTuner.
