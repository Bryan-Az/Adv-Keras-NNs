# [Part 2] KerasTuner, Custom Layers, Optimization, Custom Loss/Regularizer, Training, and Evaluation
In this section, the tabular model in part 1 is advanced by adding important model attributes such as normalization, optimization, loss, and activation and Hyperparameter tuning.

 > Custom Layer: Einsum matrix multiplication.

 > Optimizer and Initialization applied: Adam Momentum Optimizer

 > Custom Loss Metric Applied: HuberLoss.

 > Custom Activation Applied: l1 regularizer

> Hyperparameter tuning: KerasTuner.
