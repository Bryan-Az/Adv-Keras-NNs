# Tensorflow Tabular 
In this section I A/B test advanced methods in constructing neural networks (Notebook A) to a simpler model construction (Notebook B).


## Notebook A
> Keras and other advanced methods to augment the data, regularize the model weights, and tune the hyperparameters were added to the custom tabular model in a seperate notebook to compare the difference on performance.

## Notebook B
> A 3 layer deep non-linear Tensorflow neural network using a simple matrix multiplication in the custom forward method. 3 variables were used in the non linear equation.
