# Tabular Prediction: A/B Regularization Testing & Time-Series Data Augmentation
In this section I A/B test regularizations and training methods in Tensorflow vs. Keras. Time-series

> Notebook A Applies:
- Regularizations: BatchNorm in sequential API, L1, Dropout, and Earlystop: Validation Loss

> Notebook B Applies:
- Regularizations: BatchNorm in Keras API, L2, Montecarlo dropout, and Earlystop: Validation Loss
